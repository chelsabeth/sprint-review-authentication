# sprint-review-authentication
a little sprint review for you ♥️

## Welcome developers! Follow these steps to get started 👇

- [ ] fork & clone this repo 
- [ ] `cd` into your project
- [ ] create your own branch - `firstname-lastname`
- [ ] `npm i` to get all node dependencies 

## We will be building a project that follows these guidlines 

- [ ] build a `register` and `login` inside the `auth` folder. A `user` has a `username` and `password`
- [ ] build `authentication` middleware inside the `auth` folder - no user should be able to view the cat facts unless they have a `token`

## Stretch 

- [ ] create a `react-app` that connects to your API
